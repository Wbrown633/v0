        # I wish this was an Icon view but the following things need to be fixed for that to work
        # 1. The default font size set in widget.kv needs to be over-ridden so that the font is not cut off as it is now
        # 2. The columns must be constrained so that there are fewer icons per row allowing the text to have more space
        # or 
        # 3. The file name is shortened to just "16v0" so that the file names are readable with fix from #1
